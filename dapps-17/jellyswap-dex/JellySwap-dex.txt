What is JellySwap?

JellySwap is a DEX but not a usual one.
 It works on several blockchains and aims to solve the interoperability 
 issues between the different networks – a huge problem discussed lately within 
 the whole crypto community. It enables value transfer between different chains
 such as BTC<>ETH. Despite the ambitious technology it’s based on, Jelly has
 a maximally Uniswap-like UX – simple and intuitive. It is a 100% decentralized,
 non-custodial and permissionless app. Apart from swapping coins, 
 Jelly also enables everyone to provide liquidity and to become market makers in order 
 to earn profit. At the beginning of August, we released a mobile wallet which, 
 as far as we are aware, is the first of its kind for cross-chain trades via phone. 
 Our next goal – integrating more networks (Avalanche, Algorand, Harmony, etc.).
 It’s high time to build a solid infrastructure that allows exchange of native 
 coins between different chains in a smooth and trustless way!
